# Week 3: Exer 03 JavaScript Basics Part 1.

## Description

I did a simple javascript program that makes a sort of simulation of entering a password and making an object called User.
The program can check if two passwords are the same as well as validation like at least 1 small or big letter and etc,.
The program can also reverse a string. This will be used in creating a user. 
When creating a user, I check heir password if they are valid, if yes, reverse the password and set it as their new password. 

## Challenges encountered

I was trying to figure out how to access the object using "console.log(Object.keys(user2))" when all I had to do was console.log(user2).

## Solutions

Google and Trying again and again
